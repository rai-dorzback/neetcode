# Neetcode
Going through the neetcode 150

This repo is filled with my solutions to the Neetcode 150. I am doing this to get more comfortable with data structures & algorithms as I prepare for job interviews.

## How It's Made
I solve the problems in JavaScript and sometimes Python as well.

## Optimizations
As I do each solution, I usually start with a brute force version or just the first solution I think of. After, I try to optimize it to be more efficient.

## Lessons Learned
- Contains Duplicate
    - Sometimes when solving these problems you realize how simple an answer can be. I sometimes overcomplicate a solution and think too hard about it when there is really a simpler answer. This is how I felt when I realized I could create a set out of the array of nums to get the unique values and just compare the set size to the array length to figure out if there were duplicates! I'll be remembering this for next time.
    - Data Structure Used: Hash Set
- Top K Frequent Elements
  - I first did a brute force solution and when I looked at the "hint" it said my solution was "naive" ðŸ˜­. The most solution they had was a bucket sort. Tomorrow I am going to work on learning bucket sort and min-heap since these are new for me!
  - This was my first exposure to using the bucket sort algorithm
